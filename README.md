### Wave Print Column Wise
    Take as input a two-d array. Wave print it column-wise.
    Input Format
      Two integers M(row) and N(colomn) and further M * N integers(2-d array numbers).
    Constraints -> Both M and N are between 1 to 10.
    Output Format
      All M * N integers seperated by commas with 'END' wriiten in the end(as shown in example).
### Target Sum Pair
    Take as input N, the size of array. Take N more inputs and store that in an array. 
    Take as input “target”, a number. Write a function which prints all pairs of numbers which sum to target.
    Input Format
        The first line contains input N. Next N lines contains the elements of array and (N+1)th line contains target number.
    Constraints -> Length of the arrays should be between 1 and 1000.
    Output Format
        Print all the pairs of numbers which sum to target. Print each pair in increasing order.
